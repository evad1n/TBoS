HELP

Long ago, the Titan Nemesis slew the Titan Tyche in a great battle. 
The Tychans were cast out into the sea, save a few who managed to escape on the floating remains of Tyche which were scattered to the heavens. 
Their last hope in reclaiming their homeland is to recover the magical Bonds of Tyche hidden away in these scattered remains before they can be
destroyed by the Nemesians.
